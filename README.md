# Introduction
This is a front-end assignment from [Fjorge](https://fjorge.com/). The project was built using TailwindCSS for the most part.

## Deployments
The project has been deployed on both Netlify at [https://fjorge-sosthenes.netlify.app/](https://fjorge-sosthenes.netlify.app/) and on Render at [https://fjorge.onrender.com/](https://fjorge.onrender.com/). New commits are automatically deployed on both hosts. They both pull from the 'main' branch, but in a real-world scenario, one of them can be a staging server pulling from a different branch.

## Dependencies
- (Slider) [Slideshow Parallax with Tweenmax](https://codepen.io/bcarvalho/pen/gWPvJB)
- (jQuery) [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- (CSS layout) [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- (Material design icon) [Iconify](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/mdi/)

## Possible Improvements
- Fix slider caption transitions
- Add smooth transitions to the mobile menu.
- Reconsider hero/slider area styling on mobile.
- Replace Iconify with raw SVG since it is used for just 1 icon (reduce extra dependency calling).
- Remove material design fonts since they are not used in the project.
